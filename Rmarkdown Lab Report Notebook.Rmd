## **Introduction**

This report deals with the impacts of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers used in agriculture and their effect on the terrestrial and hydrological ecosystem. Increased inputs of nitrogen and phosphate cause eutrophication in water bodies, both marine and freshwater. The term eutrophication describes a process in which an ecosystem is brought out of balance by an oversupply of nutrients. This triggers an increased growth of single-celled algae in the water bodies, which are mainly found in the upper, light-flooded water layers. As a result of the increasing algae biomass, fewer light can penetrate the surface layers and reach other plants and living organisms further down. Additionally, algae have relatively short life-cycles meaning that soon after dead algae biomass accumulates and sinks to the ground. The subsequent decomposition of the dead algae consumes a lot of oxygen making the conditions for the other organisms even more hostile. Starved of light and oxygen, more and more species start to die, depending on their tolerance to the changing habitat conditions. Ultimately this process can lead to a significant biodiversity loss in the given ecosystem. While in a healthy ecosystem, the nutrient supply would regulate the amount of algae present, eutrophication thus describes a scenario in which an excessive nutrient input leads to a single cell algal bloom, which causes the loss of biodiversity and a significant oxygen deficiency in water bodies. (Federal Environment Agency. 2020)

The input of these excess nutrients usually stems from agriculture, communal wastewater treatment facilities and the industrial sector. However, the input from agriculture represents the largest share. Agriculture uses nitrogen fertilizers to fertilize its lands, which are responsible for 90% of the nitrogen introduced to groundwater (Taube et al. 2020. P. 7). Agriculture is also the leading cause for phosphate input into water bodies. Other areas, such as municipal wastewater treatment plants, were able to reduce their phosphate input over the past decades. (Ibid.)

The consequences of eutrophication make it clear the immediate action against water pollution is required, a task which is supervised by the Water Protection Directive of the European Union. However, it is the federal government which has the tools for direct action and is thus responsible to combat water pollution on a national level, including ensuring a reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen input to protect water ecosystems.Â 

Since eutrophication of water bodies is such an important topic the state of different water bodies in Germany is constantly being observed and data on the trends over the past years is easily available. Additionally, data on the use of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in the german agricultural sector can also be accessed. Since the links between fertilizer use in agriculture and excessive nutrient input into water ecosystems is well documented and understood in the scientific literature, the goal of this report is to see if such correlations can also be observed when looking just at already available datasets. The analysis is thus structured into two steps, in the first step three different datasets on fertilizer use and water eutrophication are considered separately and the trends of their individual developments are visualized. In the second step the datasets are combined and compared with one another. Since two of the datasets also include a target value which is to be reached by 2030, the analysis also takes a look at the overall development over the past years and compares this to what is required in order to reach the 2030 target. Thus, a conclusion can be made on whether or not the given target can be reached if the trends of the past decades are continued at the same rate.

## **About the Data**

Two datasets used in this analysis are taken from the website of the German Federal Environmental Agency (FEA). The third dataset is from Eurostat. The Federal Environmental Agency collects data on the environment in Germany, covering a wide range of topics from waste management to climate change. The Federal Environmental Agency collects the data, researches the interrelationships and enables forecasts to be made for the future. In addition, the FEA also provides an interface between the law and the implementation of laws. Accompanying laws into practice is thus another one of the office's responsibilities (Umweltbundesamt, 2018).

Eurostat, as the statistical office of the European Union, is the source for the dataset on phosphate fertilizers and their use in Germany. The agency's mission is to provide high quality statistics and data on Europe in cooperation with national offices. (eurostat n.d.)

The data used in this work mainly consider the environmental impacts of specific substances namely phosphate and nitrogen on the environment, specifically on hydrological systems, looking at the annual evolution over a period of time. The aim of the work is to put the different data in context and to provide a possible forecast for the year 2030. However, it should be noted that any forecast that is made here is only made in direct relation to the limited available data from the examined datasets, so that there can be no claim of completeness or accuracy of the forecast, since in a real-world setting many other factors are at play.

In this work the following datasets are compared with each other: Sampling sites which exceed the requirement for positive status for total phosphorus in rivers, nitrogen surplus of the national farm-gate balance and an overview of the annual use of phosphate fertilizer in Germany. The datasets used show data from different points in time, therefore in the first step of the analysis the individual datasets are considered alone. Only in the second step of the analysis the data are merged and compared and there only from the common years.

## **Research Focus**

## **The Analysis**

Our data analysis technically started before we even imported our datasets into RStudio for the first time. As you can see in the *data_raw* folder, the original files include a lot of additional information and explanations on the data, which get in the way when importing them into RStudio directly. We therefore cleaned the datasets up a little in Excel to include just the needed values. The clean datasets, as well as a merged dataframe of all our datasets can be found in *data_clean*.

### **Getting started with RMarkdown**

We began by loading all our required R packages:

```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(scales)
    library(gridExtra)
    library(stats)
    library(dplyr)
```

And then importing the clean datasets from our folder:

```{r}
library(readxl)
eutrophication_rivers <- read_excel("data_clean/eutrophierung_fluesse_gueteklassen.xlsx", 
   col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric", 
   "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))

phosphate_agri <- read_excel("data_clean/PhosphatLW_pro_Jahr.xlsx", 
   col_types = c("text", "numeric"))

nitrogen_agri <- read_excel("data_clean/Stickstoff_LW_kg_pro_hektar.xlsx", 
   col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

We then took a first look at the data we just imported:

```{r}
View(eutrophication_rivers)
View(nitrogen_agri)
View(phosphate_agri)
```

As you can see the three tables all differ in number of columns and in the time span they cover. To get a more organized starting point for our further data analysis. For this purpose we joined all three imported datasets into one overall dataframe. We used the year dates column of the **eutrophication_rivers** to join them by as a time scale is something all three datasets have in common and the eutrophication measurements have the most extensive time scale. We used the dplyr approach and left_join function to combine our datasets, in order to keep rows even if some of the datasets were missing values for a given year.

```{r}
df <- left_join(eutrophication_rivers, nitrogen_agri, by = "Jahr")
df <- left_join(df, phosphate_agri, by = "Jahr")
View(df)
```

This concluded our preparation and we continued with the data analysis. To avoid everyone having to merge their dataset themselves to get the big dataframe for the analysis, a Excel version of the full dataframe can also be found in *data_clean*.

### **Step 1: Phosphate, Nitrogen, and Eutrophication, respectively**

Step one of our data analysis looks at the individual types of data i.e. how phosphate and nitrogen use in agriculture developed over time, as well as how river eutrophication changed over time.


#### Phosphate

The Phosphate column shows the consumption of phosphate fertilizer in 1,000 metric tons of plant nutrient in German agriculture from 1985 to 2019 with datapoints for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, and then continuously for each year from 2000 to 2019. Starting by turning the phosphate column into its own vector and using the summary function gives the first overview of the data.

```{r}
Phosphate <- df$Verbrauch_PhosphatLW_t
summary(Phosphate)
```

This shows that the minimum amount of phosphate used during the time data was collected was 147,000 tonnes and the maximum amount 1,055,000 tonnes. It also shows that the mean value is 320,500 tonnes while the median is at 284,000 tonnes. For the further analysis of how phosphate used developed over time we created a new table with only the phosphate values as well as the overall timeline as numeric values. We opted for the numeric format of the year dates because we found it makes setting limits for visualization plots easier later on.

```{r}
timeline_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Jahr))
df_phosphate <- tibble(timeline_numeric, Phosphate)
df_phosphate <- setNames(df_phosphate, c("Year","Phosphate_use"))
view(df_phosphate)
```

We then used the filter function to find out in which years the minimum and the maximum of tonnes of phosphate used were reached:

```{r}
df_phosphate %>% 
  select(Year, Phosphate_use) %>%
  filter(Phosphate_use == "174" | Phosphate_use == "1055")
```

Showing that the maximum of 1,055,000 tonnes was used in 1985 and the minimum was reached in 2008 with 174,000 tonnes of phosphate used as agricultural fertilizer in Germany. This already implies that the amount of phosphate used went down over time, since the maximum amount is located in the least recent year of measurement. However, it also indicates that values did not go down continuously since the minimum was not in the most recent year with available data, which was 2019. To get a better understanding of the overall development of phosphate use over time we then began to visualize our data.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_phosphate, aes(x=Year, y=Phosphate_use)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.9, fill="mediumaquamarine") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Consumption of phospate fertilizer in Germany 1985-2019") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Consumption in one thousand tons of plant nutrient")
```

As seen in the summary earlier, the maximum amount of phosphate was a little over 1,000,000 tonnes, used in 1985. The bar graph further illustrates that in the 5-year intervals between 1985 and 2000 the amount of phosphate used reduced in each of the years where data was available compared to the datapoint from five years before. However, in the timespan between the years 2000 and 2019 the reduction was not as continually. To take a closer look at this timespan we plotted a line graph covering the years 2000 to 2019.

```{r}
df_phosphate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, Phosphate_use, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="darkseagreen2", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="darkseagreen4", size=2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Consumption in one thousand tons of plant nutrient", 
       title = "Consumption of phospate fertilizer in Germany 2000-2019") +
  xlim(2000, 2020) +
  ylim(100, 400)
```
Again it can be seen that overall, the amount of phosphate fertilizers consumed each year declined. Especially in 2008 the consumption slumped. This is the minimum of 147,000 tonnes as already seen in the summary earlier. However, there has been a sharp rise in consumption in the two years that followed. And after a period of decline another rise which reached a value of around 300,000 tonnes in 2014. Since 2014, the consumption of phosphate fertilizers went down again, reaching 211,000 tonnes in 2018 and 2019.

We then made a new table and added a column on the amount of phosphate which was used more or less in comparison to the previous year and another column with the change in percent this corresponds to using the lag-function. We limited the table to the years 2001-2019 as this is the time frame for which the phosphate table has continous annual data, which is needed to assess the change in comparison to the previous year by dropping all rows which contained empty cells.
```{r}
phos_perc_change <- df_phosphate %>%
  mutate(
    Diff_amount = Phosphate_use - lag(Phosphate_use),
    Perc_change = (Phosphate_use - lag(Phosphate_use)) / lag(Phosphate_use))
phos_perc_change <- drop_na(phos_perc_change) # deletes all the row we don't need for this anyway
View(phos_perc_change)
```

We also wanted to visualize this , so next we made two graphs to show both the percentage change, as well as the total amount that had changed as compared to the value of the previous year.
```{r}
grid.arrange(ggplot(phos_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Perc_change, fill=factor(ifelse(Perc_change <0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("darkslategray3","darkslategray")) +
               scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
               xlim(2000, 2020) +
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change in comparison to the previous year (in percent)", 
                    title = "Percental change"),
             
             ggplot(phos_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Diff_amount, fill=factor(ifelse(Diff_amount <0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("darkslategray3","darkslategray")) +
               xlim(2000, 2020) +
               ylim(-150, 120) + # actually aligning them seemed to complicated so I just eyeballed it via ylim
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change (in one thousand tons of plant nutrient)", 
                    title = "Total change"), nrow = 1, top = "Increase and decline of phospate fertilizer use in Germany 2000-2019")
```
The sharp decline between the years 2007 and 2008 is clearly visible. From the graph showing the total change it can be seen that the amount of phosphate used in 2008 reduced by almost 200,000 tonnes, which corresponds to a decline of over 40 % as seen from the percental change graph.

To finish off our analysis of our data on phosphate by itself, we wanted to see how the consumption of phosphate had changed in total over the course of time, expressed in percent.
```{r}
df_phosphate %>% 
  select(Year, Phosphate_use) %>%
  filter(Year == "1985" | Year == "2019")
```
We did this by filtering for the phosphate values of our start and end year and inserting these values into a simple percentage equation. There is probably a more elegant solution for this in R, however, if there is we could not find it, or if we did did not understand what we were looking at. So, instead we dug deep trying to remember what we had learned in school about calculating with percentages and came up with this:
```{r}
label_percent(scale = 1, accuracy = 0.01)(((211 / 1055 * 100) - 100))
```
Which showed us that between the years 1985 and 2019 phosphate consumption for agricultural purposes declined by 80 %. But as we saw in the first bar chart on phosphate a large decline in consumption already took place before 2000 where only data for every fifth year is available. To take a closer look at the time frame of which we have continous data, we repeated the previous step for the years 2000-2019.
```{r}
df_phosphate %>% 
  select(Year, Phosphate_use) %>%
  filter(Year == "2000" | Year == "2019")
```

```{r}
label_percent(accuracy = 0.01, scale = 1)(((211 / 351 * 100) - 100))
```
Showing that during this time the phosphate consumption dropped by around 40% in 2019 as compared to 2000.


#### Nitrogen

The Nitrogen column shows the overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany between 1990 and 2018 in relation to agricultural used land.
The measuring unit here is kilograms of nitrogen per hectar agricultural used land in Germany (kilogram per hectar), which differs from the
measurement of phosphate measured in 1.000 metric tons of plant nutrient.
To start analizing the data of nitrogen the nitrogen column will be turned into it's own vector and the summary function is used to give a
first overview of the data.

```{r}
Nitrogen <- df$Stickstoff_Jahreswert_LW
summary(Nitrogen)
```

The minimum amount of nitrogen used in agriculture in Germany was 83.0 kg per hectar
and the maximum amount 141.0 kg per hectar. In addition one can see that the mean
value is 103.2 kg per hectar while the median is 104.0 kg.
For the further analysis of the nitrogen balance development over time we created
a new table with just the nitrogen values and a timeline of the years in numeric values.

```{r}
timeline_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Jahr))
df_nitrogen <- tibble(timeline_numeric, Nitrogen)
df_nitrogen <- setNames(df_nitrogen, c("Year","Nitrogen_use"))
view(df_nitrogen)
```

We then used the filter function to find out in which years the minimum and the maximum amount of nitrogen was reached:

```{r}
df_nitrogen %>%
  select(Year, Nitrogen_use) %>%
  filter(Nitrogen_use == "83" | Nitrogen_use == "141")
```

The maximum of nitrogen use was reached in 1990 with 141 kg per hectar and the minimum was found in 2009
with 83 kg per hectar. This already implies a deacrease of nitrogen fertilizer used in agriculture from 1990 to 2009.
However, it also shows that the values fluctuate since the minimum value is in 2009 and then went up again to 2018.
To see the development of the values we started visualizing the data to get a better understanding.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_nitrogen, aes(x=Year, y=Nitrogen_use)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.9, fill="coral") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany 1990-2018") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Consumption in kilogram per hectar in relation to agricultural used land")
```

As mentioned before, the maximum amount of nitrogen used in agriculture in Germany was found in the first year,
data was collected for that purpose with 141 kg per hectar. Since then, the values decreased to 117 kg per hectar
one year later. The tendency from that time on is a fluctuating deacrease of nitrogen use. There are three peak
values in the years 2000 with 115 kg per hectar, 2011 with 107 kg per hectar and 2015 with 103 kg per hectar.
From 1991 to 2009 the development of the data shows a rather decreasing tendency with slightly fluctuating values,
whereas since 2009 there is no continous tendency of a decrase of nitrogen use but its rather fluctuating. In 2008
we find the lowest amount of nitrogen used in agriculture in the timespan data was collected. However, since then
the data shows a high increase over 2 years to 107 kg per hectar, a decrease to almost minimum amount of nitrogen
as in 2009 and an increase again from 85 in 2014 to 103 in 2018. A general tendency of a decreasing use of nitrogen
in agriculture can be formulated, but not a linear decrease. To better evaluate the development we plottet a line
graph of the time from 2000 to 2018.

```{r}
df_nitrogen %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, Nitrogen_use, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="salmon", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="indianred", size=2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Nitrogen (t)", 
       title = "Overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany 2000-2018") +
  xlim(1990, 2020) +
  ylim(50, 150)
```

The line graph visualizes a generall decline of nitrogen consumption in german agriculture from 1990-2018.
Especially from 1990 to 2008 a clear decrease with few fluctuations of higher values in 1995 and 2000 of
nitrogen consumption can be analized. Since then, mentionable de- and inclines from the time period 2008-2015
can be seen. The graph illustrates a mentionable peak in 2011 with 107 kg per hectar compared to the years
before and after with 83 kg per hectar in 2008 and three years later in 2014 with 85 kg nitrogen per hectar.
For that time period no trend of de- or incline of nitrogen use can be seen. Afterall, from 2015 nitrogen
consumption decreases continuasly to 2019, from 103 to 89 kg nitrogen per hectar.

We built another table with an extra column for the changing amount of nitrogen from year to year and another
column for the percentage change of nitrogen from year to year by using the lag-function. We limited the table
to the years 1991-2018, as only in this time period we have continous data, which is needed for the percentage
change of nitrogen to previous years. All other cells are ignored with this step.

```{r}
nitr_perc_change <- df_nitrogen %>%
  mutate(
    Diff_amount = Nitrogen_use - lag(Nitrogen_use),
    Perc_change = (Nitrogen_use - lag(Nitrogen_use)) / lag(Nitrogen_use))
nitr_perc_change <- drop_na(nitr_perc_change) # deletes all the row we don't need for this anyway
View(nitr_perc_change)
```

In the next step this table is also visualized in two graphs, with both the percantage change and the total
amount of nitrogen use differing from one year to another. 

```{r}
grid.arrange(ggplot(nitr_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Perc_change, fill=factor(ifelse(Perc_change<0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("lightcoral","indianred4")) +
               scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
               xlim(1990, 2020) +
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change in comparison to the previous year (in percent)", 
                    title = "Percentage change"),
             
             ggplot(nitr_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Diff_amount, fill=factor(ifelse(Diff_amount <0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("lightcoral","indianred4")) +
               xlim(1990, 2020) +
               ylim(-150, 120) +
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change (in kilogram per hectar)", title = "Total change"),
                    nrow = 1, top = "Increase and decline of overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany 2000-2018")
```

With that visualization the first increase of nitrogen fertilizer compared to previous years can be seen in 1995.
Here again the most striking part becomes visible again in 2009 with a percentage change of about -18.6% to the
previous year and the following percantage change of 9.6% in 2010. Hereafter, in 2011 the percentage change is
even higher with a positive change of +17.6% compared to the year before. This underlines the fluctuation in this
time, as analized in the graph before. With the graph showing the total change one can see that the difference from
2008 to 2009 with -19 kg differnece and from 2014 to 2015 with 18 kg difference the highest is the most striking.

To finilize our analysis of the data on the overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany, we wanted to show the
total percentage change over the whole timeperiod data on nitrogen use in agriculture was collected.

```{r}
df_nitrogen %>% 
  select(Year, Nitrogen_use) %>%
  filter(Year == "1990" | Year == "2018")
```

We did this by filtering out the nitrogen values of the starting and final year and inserting these values into
the percantage equation we already came up with for the phosphate analysis.

```{r}
label_percent(accuracy = 0.01, scale = 1)(((89 / 115 * 100) - 100))
```

This shows that the overall agricultural nitrogen balance in Germany between the years 1990 and 2018 declined by -22.61%. 


#### River eutrophication

The following analysis takes a closer look at the eutrophication data for water bodies in Germany. The development is analyzed in different water quality classes (II-IV). In addition, the total eutrophication is looked at. The data are available from 1982 - 2018. or a first overview, the data important for this part of the analysis are collected from the entire data set. The data set provides conclusions about the summarized eutrophication of the water bodies, but also about the status of the different water quality classes. The water quality classes describe the condition of the water bodies. The water quality class one stands for waters without antropogenic pollution. The second class of the water quality classes in turn stands for a moderate pollution, the class II-III for a significant pollution, the class III for an increased pollution, the classes III-IV for a high pollution and the IV water quality class finally stands for a very high pollution. In the data used, the classes subjected to antroprogenic pollution are listed and analyzed for eutrophication. (BMU, 2016)

```{r}
"Quality class II-III" <- c(df$`GÃ¼teklasse_II-III`)
```

```{r}
"Quality class III" <- c(df$GÃ¼teklasse_III)
```

```{r}
"Quality class III-IV" <- c(df$`GÃ¼teklasse_III-IV`)
```

```{r}
"Quality class IV" <- c(df$GÃ¼teklasse_IV)
```

```{r}
"Total eutrophication" <- c(df$`Summe_%_Flussmessstellen`)
```

```{r}
"Year eutrophication" <- c(df$Jahr)
```

For a first overview of the data, the function summary() is applied to the individual variables.

```{r}
summary(`Total eutrophication`)
```
By using the summary() function, the minimum and maximum of the particular eutrophication are shown. The eutrophication is indicated in the data in percent. Thus, the maximum for "Total eutrophication" is 92.00% and the minimum is 0.00%. In the following, the summary() function was applied to the different quality classes. 

```{r}
summary(`Quality class II-III`)
```

```{r}
summary(`Quality class III`)
```

```{r}
summary(`Quality class III-IV`)
```

```{r}
summary(`Quality class IV`)
```
With this first operation, an overview of the minimums and maximums of the different classes and the total eutrophication could be obtained. It is noticeable that the minimum is always 0.00%. In order to examine the minimum and maximum in more detail, the data are converted to a table with the respective year numbers. 

```{r}
timeline_numeric <- as.numeric(df$Jahr)
"df_Total eutrophication" <- tibble(timeline_numeric, `Total eutrophication`)
`df_Total eutrophication` <-setNames(`df_Total eutrophication`, c("Year", "Total"))
view(`df_Total eutrophication`)
```

```{r}
"df_Quality class II-III" <- tibble(timeline_numeric, `Quality class II-III`)
`df_Quality class II-III` <- setNames(`df_Quality class II-III`, c("Year", "QC"))
view(`df_Quality class II-III`)
```

```{r}
"df_Quality class III" <- tibble(timeline_numeric, `Quality class III`)
`df_Quality class III` <- setNames(`df_Quality class III`, c("Year", "QC"))
view(`df_Quality class III`)
```

```{r}
"df_Quality class III-IV" <- tibble(timeline_numeric, `Quality class III-IV`)
`df_Quality class III-IV` <- setNames(`df_Quality class III-IV`, c("Year", "QC"))
view(`df_Quality class III-IV`)
```

```{r}
"df_Quality class IV" <- tibble(timeline_numeric, `Quality class IV`)
`df_Quality class IV` <- setNames(`df_Quality class IV`, c("Year", "QC"))
view(`df_Quality class IV`)
```

The newly created data sets are filtered in detail to the minimums and maximums of the respective years in order to make a more accurate statement about the data.

The filter function shows that the minimum is 2030 in any case. This allows the conclusion that this is the goal of the development and that the eutrophication should have decreased to 0.00% by 2030. In order to look at this development in more detail, the individual data sets are presented graphically in the following. 

At this point it should be noted that the filter function did not work for all data sets as a whole. Unfortunately, no maximum values could be determined for the water quality classes II-III, III and IV. By looking at the data sets, it became apparent that the missing data were all decimal numbers. A possible source of error could be the transfer of comma and point, since our data set is in German and R works in English, the error could be there, but this is also only a guess. By different attempts again and again no results for the maximum and minimum could be obtained.  In addition, it was also tried to search for the complete number with all decimal places, but this also did not lead to the desired result, so that the results could only be displayed incompletely. 

```{r}
`df_Total eutrophication`%>% 
  select(Year, Total) %>%
  filter(Total == "92" | Total == "0")
```

```{r}
`df_Quality class II-III`%>% 
  select(Year, QC) %>%
  filter(QC == "61.29" | QC == "0")
```

```{r}
`df_Quality class III`%>% 
  select(Year, QC) %>%
  filter(QC == "45" | QC == "0")
```

```{r}
`df_Quality class III-IV`%>% 
  select(Year, QC) %>%
  filter(QC == "38" | QC == "0")
```

```{r}
`df_Quality class IV`%>% 
  select(Year, QC) %>%
  filter(QC == "18" | QC == "0")
```

The first graph shows the total eutrophication from 1982 - 2018. The trend is clearly to reduce eutrophication, although the target of 0.00% eutrophication in 2030 still seems far away. But this will be examined in more detail below.

```{r}
ggplot(data = `df_Total eutrophication`, aes(x=Year, y=Total)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.9, fill="darkslateblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Development of water eutrophication in Germany from 1982 - 2018") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Eutrophication (%)")
```
The following graphs show the development of the different water quality classes in more detail and allow a conclusion to be drawn about the development and the achievement of the targets. The development in water quality class II-III indicates an increasing development of eutrophication until 2015. From 2015 the eutrophication decreases slightly, but the value is still over 50% in 2018, so the target of 0.00% eutrophication by 2030 seems far away. 

```{r}
`df_Quality class II-III` %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, QC, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="aquamarine3", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="brown2", size=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Eutrophication (%)", 
       title = "Development of water quality class II-III in Germany 1982-2018") +
  xlim(1982, 2030) +
  ylim(0, 100)
```
Water quality class III is considered in the third presentation. The development shows the highest level of eutrophication in 1993. From this time on, the trend is downward, but always with increasing outbreaks of eutrophication between the different years. In the last measured year 2018, however, the eutrophication is below five percent.

```{r}
`df_Quality class III` %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, QC, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="aquamarine3", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="brown2", size=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Eutrophication (%)", 
       title = "Development of water quality class III in Germany 1982-2018") +
  xlim(1982, 2030) +
  ylim(0, 100)
```

The graph for water quality classes III-IV, on the other hand, shows a clear downward trend in eutrophication. The highest level was reached in 1986 and continued to fall after 1989 until it dropped below five percent in 1994. In the following years up to 2018, eutrophication no longer breaks the five percent barrier.

```{r}
`df_Quality class III-IV` %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, QC, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="aquamarine3", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="brown2", size=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Eutrophication (%)", 
       title = "Development of water quality class III-IV in Germany 1982-2018") +
  xlim(1982, 2030) +
  ylim(0, 100)
```

The last graphic again deals explicitly with water quality class IV. The peak of the class is, as can be seen from the previous graph, before 1990, more specifically 1985. As of 1992, the eutrophication in this class no longer exceeds the five percent barrier. 

```{r}
`df_Quality class IV` %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, QC, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(linetype="solid", color="aquamarine3", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="brown2", size=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Eutrophication (%)", 
       title = "Development of water quality class IV in Germany 1982-2018") +
  xlim(1982, 2030) +
  ylim(0, 100)
```
By presenting the data in this graphs, the developments of water quality classes III, III-IV and IV can be named with a clear positive trend towards attainment of 0.00% eutrophication in 2030.

The data can be used to forecast trends towards the 0.00% eutrophication target. However, it should be noted that the prediction cannot be considered complete, as there are many more factors involved in reducing eutrophication. 

Since the development of the water quality classes has already been broadly represented by the graphs. The forecast for the year 2030 refers to the summarized measurements of the water quality classes.

```{r}
`df_Total eutrophication` %>% 
  select(Year, Total) %>%
  filter(Year == "1982" | Year == "2018")
```

```{r}
label_percent(scale = 1)(((55.7 / 86.4 * 100) - 100))
```
The first calculation shows the decrease in eutrophication from 1982 - 2018. The decrease over the entire measurement period is 36%. To make a forecast for the year 2030 the years 1985 - 2000 and 2000 - 2015 are looked at in the next operations. The resulting values will be used to forecast to 2030. 
```{r}
`df_Total eutrophication` %>% 
  select(Year, Total) %>%
  filter(Year == "1982" | Year == "2000")
```

```{r}
label_percent(scale = 1)(((71.2 / 86.4 * 100) - 100))
```

```{r}
`df_Total eutrophication` %>% 
  select(Year, Total) %>%
  filter(Year == "2000" | Year == "2018")
```

```{r}
label_percent(scale = 1)(((55.7 / 71.2 * 100) - 100))
```
The decrease in eutrophication was -18% from 1982 - 2000 and -22% in the following 18 years. This results in an average decrease in eutrophication of 1.1% per year for this period of 36 years.  

```{r}
"Decreas per Year" <- (40/36)
view(`Decreas per Year`)
```

For the next 12 years, if eutrophication continues to decrease, this would mean another 13.2% decrease. Conversely, based on these data, this would mean that in 2030 the water bodies would still be up to 46.8% eutrophicated. So the target of 0.00% would have been missed.

The total eutrophication data were calculated by changing the percentages, i.e. the respective increase or decrease in eutrophication.On the one hand the increase and decrease between the years in percent and on the other hand the total change from 1982 - 2018 were considered. Both diagrams should visualize the change again and make it more clearly visible. 


```{r}
eutrophication_perc_change <- `df_Total eutrophication` %>%
  mutate(Diff_amount = `Total eutrophication` - lag(`Total eutrophication`),
    Perc_change = (`Total eutrophication` - lag(`Total eutrophication`)) / lag(`Total eutrophication`))
eutrophication_perc_change <- drop_na(eutrophication_perc_change) 
View(eutrophication_perc_change)
```


```{r}
grid.arrange(ggplot(eutrophication_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Perc_change, fill=factor(ifelse(Perc_change <0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("goldenrod1","darkslateblue")) +
               scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
               xlim(1982, 2020) +
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change in comparison to the previous year (in percent)", 
                    title = "Percentage change"),
             
             ggplot(eutrophication_perc_change, aes(x=Year, y=Diff_amount, fill=factor(ifelse(Diff_amount <0, "positive", "negative")))) +
               geom_col() +
               theme_minimal() +
               scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, name = "Type of change", values=c("goldenrod1","darkslateblue")) +
               xlim(1982, 2020) +
               ylim(-10, 10) + 
               labs(x = "Time (years)", 
                    y = "Change (in %)", 
                    title = "Total change"), nrow = 1, top = "Increase and decline of eutrophication in rivers of Germany 1982-2018")
```


## **Discussion**

The data show a trend of reduction of phosphate and nitrate inputs into the ecosystem of water bodies. This in turn has a positive effect on the eutrophication in water bodies and their condition. With the exclusive consideration of these data the analysis comes to the conclusion that a decrease until 2030 of the phosphate values up to 0.0 % is possible. For nitrate inputs, a reduction of 37.5% is possible according to the current approach. However, it was already mentioned at the beginning of the work that not only agriculture is involved in the input of nitrate and phosphate, but also other carriers such as industry and municipal wastewater treatment plants. In recent years, the latter have significantly reduced their nutrient inputs to water bodies, whereas agriculture has remained relatively constant. (Taube et al. 2020. P. 7f.) The improvement in water quality could therefore also be attributed to the reduction in municipal wastewater treatment plants and less to the measures in agriculture. 
Reduction in agriculture is an acute problem. In order to protect ecosystems and not violate the EU Nitrate Directive. The European Union has already reminded Germany several times to implement the Nitrates Directive and reduce the input from agriculture (European Commission. 2019). 

The directive is a further motivation to get the limitation of fertilization under control the eutrophication in Germany is a major problem and must be effectively pursued by the federal government in the coming years. According to the considered data, the values for nitrate and phosphate input are decreasing, however, the level of eutrophication in the water bodies and the target of 0.0% eutrophication by 2030 cannot be reached. By 2030, relying on the data of water bodies eutrophication and observing the previous reduction, the water bodies can be cleared of 53.2% eutrophication. 

Agriculture is the main sector responsible for the input of substances and the resulting eutrophication (Umweltbundesamt, 2017: p. 70). Therefore, the greatest measures to limit the input of phosphate and nitrate are to be taken in agriculture. The dense livestock farming in Germany contributes to a large extent to the overfertilization and eventual eutrophication of land and water systems. In addition, the settlement of species atypical to the location leads to a necessary fertilization, which in turn results in a high nutrient input into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In the coming years, animal husbandry and fertilization regulations must therefore be adapted to protect land and water systems. (NABU, n.d. p. 2) Eutrophication is one of the problems caused by the introduction of phosphate and nitrate in these quantities. Degradation of drinking water quality is another. Acting in this area is consequently essential.

## **Limitations**

Since only working with already collected data and a dataset which is limited to the annual overall use of phosphate and nitrogen in agriculture over a period of time, as well as a set of measurements on eutrophication in river ecosystems, this report can make no claim on providing a complete analysis of the topic. Furthermore, even where correlations between the different datasets can be observed, this does not imply causation, since other factors which were not accounted for in our datasets may be at play.Â
